# wasmtime-async

This crate was an extension to the
[`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/README.md)
crate.

Since then, `wasmtime` upstream has gained the features that this crate
provided.

If you are interested in archeology, feel free to dig into the history of this
repository, but it is no longer containing anything useful.
